    "[Q] How to determine if a review is positive or negative?<br>\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "[Ans] We could use Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 can be cosnidered as a positive review. A rating of 1 or 2 can be considered as negative one. A review of rating 3 is considered nuetral and such reviews are ignored from our analysis. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) of a review.\n",

    "### 4. So after we tokenize we pad the data as all the data which we input should be similar in dimensions.\n",
    "### 5. Then for modeling we used sequential models, which are simple and pretty straight forward.\n",
    "### 6. Model 1 is containing only one LSTM layer with relu activation, it also consists of one dropout layer as well.\n",
    "### 7. Model 2 is containing two LSTM layers and one dropout layer.\n",
    "### 8. For final output layer dense layer is used with sigmoid activation.\n",
    "### 8. Loss function used is binary_crossentrop here as we have a binary classification problem at hand.\n",
